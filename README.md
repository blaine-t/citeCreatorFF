# Modern Cite Creator

This is my updating and porting of the extension [Cite Creator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-creator/jampigcbgngjedogaoglhpeckidccodi) to Firefox. I have also updated the code base from deprecated code to modern code since the extension was last released in 2016. It should now be written in a way that it is usable in any modern browser (until Chrome kills Manifest V2). Tested in Chrome 115 and Firefox 115

## Special Thanks To

Aaron Hardy over at [Paperless Debate](https://paperlessdebate.com/) for the original Chrome extension
