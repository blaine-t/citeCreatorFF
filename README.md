# Cite Creator Firefox

This is my porting of the extension [Cite Creator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-creator/jampigcbgngjedogaoglhpeckidccodi) to Firefox. I've always wanted to use the extension in Firefox so I finally decided to port it. I plan on building a 2.0 version with improved features but for now I have feature parity with Cite Creator Chrome.

## Special Thanks To

Aaron Hardy over at [Paperless Debate](https://paperlessdebate.com/) for the original Chrome extension
