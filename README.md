## Problem

I have always wanted to be able to use the [Cite Creator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-creator/jampigcbgngjedogaoglhpeckidccodi) extension by Aaron Hardy from [Paperless Debate](https://paperlessdebate.com/) but I am a Firefox user and the extension was never available for Firefox. Since the extension is licensed under GPL-3.0 I decided to port the extension to Firefox and [MV3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) so that when [Google phases out MV2 extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/migrating/mv2-sunset/) like Cite Creator there will be an alternative available.

## Solution

That's why I developed Modern Cite Creator so that anyone can use Cite Creator in the future.

Downloads available here:

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/modern-cite-creator/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modern-cite-creator/njhljhbpckebinlkjaphbjekbajhelpp?hl=en)
- [MV2 (1.2.0)](https://github.com/blaine-t/modern-cite-creator/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
- [MV3 (1.3.0)](https://github.com/blaine-t/modern-cite-creator/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

There is little to no code changes in the extension besides a couple security fixes since the old code used deprecated code but besides that it's the same extension you know and love just updated for modern browsers.

## Future

It should also work for other browsers if anyone wants me to look into publishing the extension for their browser of choice! Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/blaine-t/modern-cite-creator/issues) for issues or additional browser support.

## Special Thanks To

Aaron Hardy over at [Paperless Debate](https://paperlessdebate.com/) for the [original Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-creator/jampigcbgngjedogaoglhpeckidccodi)
